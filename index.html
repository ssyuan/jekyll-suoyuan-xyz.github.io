<div class="main-explain-area jumbotron">
    <p><b>A zero-knowledge Move language virtual machine</b>, to improve programmability and composability of zero-knowledge application. As a new generation of programming language for digital assets, Move guarantees security of assets at the language level.</p>
    <p><b>Powered by Halo2</b>. Halo2 uses Plonkish arithmetization, fitable for constructing complicated circuit. No trusted setup required.</p>
    <p><b>No compromise on performance while pursuing Turing completeness</b>. Two types of circuits are combined: VM circuits to handle conditional branches and loops, and Move circuits, which directly compiled from bytecodes, offer smaller proof size and shorter proving time.</p>
